NAME
    Set::Crontab - Expand crontab(5)-style integer lists

SYNOPSIS
    $s = Set::Crontab->new("1-9/3,>15,>30,!23", [0..30]);

    if ($s->contains(3)) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    Set::Crontab parses crontab-style lists of integers and defines some
    utility functions to make it easier to deal with them.

  Syntax

    Numbers, ranges, *, and step values all work exactly as described in
    the crontab(5) manpage. A few extensions to the standard syntax are
    described below.

    < and >
        <N selects the elements smaller than N from the entire range,
        and adds them to the set. >N does likewise for elements larger
        than N.

    !   !N excludes N from the set. It applies to the other specified
        range; otherwise it applies to the specified ranges (i.e. "!3"
        with a range of "1-10" corresponds to "1-2,4-10", but ">3,!7" in
        the same range means "4-6,8-10").

  Functions

    new($spec, [@range])
        Creates a new Set::Crontab and returns a reference to it.

    contains($num)
        Returns true if `$num' exists in the set.

    list()
        Returns the expanded list corresponding to the set.

    The functions described above croak if they are called with
    incorrect arguments.
